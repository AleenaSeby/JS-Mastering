## 🔹 Core Concepts  

### 🔸 What is `this`?  
`this` is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the execution context (the object that is currently calling the function).  
Its value is determined **at runtime**, not at declaration.  

---

### 🔸 What is an Object in JavaScript?  
An object is a collection of key–value pairs (properties and methods).  

- Keys are **strings or symbols**.  
- Values can be **any data type** (including other objects or functions).  

---

### 🔸 What is a Prototype?  
Every object in JavaScript has a hidden property called `[[Prototype]]` (sometimes shown as `__proto__`).  
A prototype is itself an object, used as a **blueprint** for other objects.  

- **Object** = collection of properties & methods (real data).  
- **Prototype** = “blueprint” object used for inheritance (shared methods/behaviors).  
- **Prototype chain** = JS looks up properties through a chain of objects until it finds it (or reaches `null`).  

**Key points:**  
- The prototype chain enables inheritance in JavaScript.  
- If a property isn’t found on an object, JavaScript looks up its prototype chain.  
- The prototype of an object instance → `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or `__proto__`.  
- The prototype of a constructor function → `Constructor.prototype`.  
- The chain ends when the prototype is `null`.  

---

### 🔸 `Object.assign()`  
Used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects into a target object.  
Mainly used for **cloning** and **merging**.  

---

### 🔸 Singleton  
A singleton is an object that can only be instantiated **once**.  
Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance.  

---

### 🔸 `call`, `apply`, and `bind`  
Ways to explicitly control the value of `this`.  

---

### 🔸 JSON  
`JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` is a lightweight, text-based data format using JS object syntax.  
- Popularized by Douglas Crockford.  
- Widely used for transmitting data between a server and a client.  

---

### 🔸 Array Methods: `slice()` vs `splice()`  
- `slice()` → does **not mutate** the original array, returns a **new array**.  
- `splice()` → **modifies** the original array, returns removed elements.  

```js
array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)

// Can remove and insert elements in a single operation.
```

---

## 🔸 Maps in JavaScript  

- A `Map` is a built-in object introduced in **ES6** that is designed specifically for **key–value storage**.  
- Keys can be of **any type** (objects, functions, primitives).  
- Maintains **insertion order** of keys.  
- Provides **useful built-in methods** like `.set()`, `.get()`, `.has()`, `.delete()`, and `.size`.  

---

## 🔸 Equality in JavaScript  

```js
0 == false            // true   (loose equality, type coercion)
0 === false           // false  (strict equality, different types)

1 == "1"              // true   (string converted to number)
1 === "1"             // false  (different types)

null == undefined     // true   (special case)
null === undefined    // false  (different types)

'0' == false          // true   ('0' is converted to 0)
'0' === false         // false  (different types)

NaN == NaN            // false  (NaN is never equal to itself)
NaN === NaN           // false

[] == []              // false  (different array objects)
[] === []             // false

{} == {}              // false  (different object references)
{} === {}             // false
```

### Lambda Expressions / Arrow Functions  
Shorter and more readable, especially for simple operations or callbacks.  

---

### First-Class Functions / Citizens  

You can assign a function to a variable:  
```js
const greet = function(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
};
console.log(greet("Aleena")); // Hello, Aleena
```
##### You can pass a function as an argument to another function.
```
function sayHello() {
  return "Hello!";
}

function greet(fn) {
  console.log(fn()); 
}

greet(sayHello);  // "Hello!"
```
##### You can return a function from another function.
```
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```
Here, multiplier returns a function → closure is formed.
##### Why is This Important?
 Because of first-class functions, JavaScript supports:
- Callbacks (functions passed as arguments).
- Higher-order functions (functions that take/return other functions).
- Functional programming patterns (map, filter, reduce).
- Async programming (promises, async/await use callbacks under the hood).
### Function Types  

- **First-order function** → does not take another function as an argument and does not return another function.  
- **Higher-order function** → either accepts another function as an argument, returns a function as its result, or both.  
- **Unary function (monadic)** → a function that accepts exactly one argument.  
- **Currying** → process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nested functions, each accepting only one argument at a time.  
```
const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;

console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1));       // Returns: function (b) => ...
console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2));    // Returns: function (c) => ...
console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6
```

### Pure vs Impure Functions  

👉 **Pure Function**  
- Always returns the same output for the same input.  
- Has no side effects (doesn’t modify external state, global variables, DOM, API calls, etc.).  

👉 **Impure Function**  
- May return different outputs for the same inputs.  
- Has side effects (modifies external state, logs to console, changes global variables, DOM, database, etc.).  

###  let - block-scoped local variable.
### var - function-scoped (or globally-scoped if declared outside a function)
| Feature           | `var`                                | `let`                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**         | Function-scoped                      | Block-scoped (`{}`)                                  |
| **Hoisting**      | Hoisted & initialized as `undefined` | Hoisted but **not initialized** (Temporal Dead Zone) |
| **Redeclaration** | Can be redeclared in the same scope  | Cannot be redeclared in the same scope               |
| **Reassignment**  | Allowed                              | Allowed                                              |
| **Best Use**      | Legacy code (avoid if possible)      | Modern JS (preferred)                                |
###  Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) - period between the start of a block and the point where a variable declared with let or const is initialized. During this time, the variable exists in scope but cannot be accessed, and attempting to do so results in a ReferenceError.

### IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,
The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world.
```
(function () {
  // logic here
})();
```

**Memoization** is a functional programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. 
**Hoisting** is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

### A closure is formed when an inner function “remembers” the variables from its outer function’s scope, even after the outer function has finished running.
```
function outer() {
  let count = 0; // variable in outer scope

  function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }

  return inner;
}

const counter = outer(); // outer() returns inner function
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3
```
✅ Here’s what happens:
outer() runs once and returns inner.
Normally, count would be gone when outer() finishes.
But because inner closes over count, it still “remembers” it.
This is a closure.

🔹 What is a Service Worker?
A Service Worker is a script that runs in the background of your browser, separate from the web page.
It acts like a proxy between your web app, the network, and the cache.
It lets you control how network requests are handled (e.g., cache first, network first).
👉 Think of it as a behind-the-scenes helper that can:
Make your app work offline
Cache files for faster loading
Handle push notifications
Do background sync
🔹 Life Cycle of a Service Worker
Register → Your page tells the browser to use a service worker.
Install → The service worker is downloaded and cached.
Activate → It takes control of the page.
Listen → It intercepts requests (like fetch, push, sync).
