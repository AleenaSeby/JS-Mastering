* -> What is this?
this is a special keyword in JavaScript that refers to the execution context (the object that is currently calling the function).
Its value is determined at runtime, not at declaration.
* -> What is an Object in JavaScript?

An object is a collection of key–value pairs (properties and methods).

Keys are strings or symbols, and values can be any data type (including other objects or functions).
* ->  What is a Prototype?

Every object in JavaScript has a hidden property called [[Prototype]] (sometimes shown as __proto__).

A prototype is itself an object, used as a blueprint for other objects.

If you try to access a property that doesn’t exist on the object, JavaScript will look for it in the prototype chain.
